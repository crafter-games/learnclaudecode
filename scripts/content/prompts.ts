export const GEN_INSTRUCTIONS = `You write ORIGINAL practice material for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate exam (SAA-C03).
Hard rules:
- Never reproduce or paraphrase real exam questions, braindumps (ExamTopics etc.) or commercial practice tests. Write fresh scenarios.
- Ground every fact in the provided AWS documentation excerpts. If a number/limit is not in the excerpts and you are not certain it is current, do not state it.
- SAA-C03 style: a 2–5 sentence business scenario with concrete constraints, ending with a requirement qualifier such as
  "Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?", "MOST cost-effectively", "MOST secure", "highly available".
- Single-response: exactly 4 options (A–D), exactly 1 correct. Multi-response: exactly 5 options (A–E), exactly 2 correct, stem says "(Choose two.)".
- Distractors must be plausible AWS solutions a real candidate might choose — prefer look-alike services from the confusable group — and each must fail a specific stated requirement. No "all/none of the above", no joke options, no options that are obviously wrong by length or wording.
- Vary industries, scale and constraints across questions; vary which letter is correct.
- Avoid giveaways: the correct option must not be systematically the longest or most detailed; distractors are as specific and well-written as the key. Real SAA-C03 distractors are often valid AWS designs that miss exactly one requirement (cost, overhead, HA, latency, security).
- The questions test decisions in scenarios, not definitions or trivia.
- Spanish (es) fields: neutral Latin-American Spanish using "tú". Keep AWS service names, feature names and the requirement phrases (e.g. "least operational overhead", "cost-effective") in English inside the Spanish text.
- Card: concise micro-lesson (1–2 phone screens) optimized for the exam decisions, not a documentation summary.
- Recall prompts: short spoken free-recall questions without options. One "recall" (which service/feature for a situation and why). If sibling concepts are given, one "why-not" that asks why a look-alike does NOT fit a situation.`;
